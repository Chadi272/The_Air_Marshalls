# The_Air_Marshalls

The project will analyze the flights’ delays, cancellations and other statuses in the US for 322 different airlines. The dataset contains just above 5 million records with 31 columns. The findings will be presented to a potential airline company “Multico Air”, that want to enter the market, looking at flight delays in the industry to target a niche between the competitors. The presentation will target the GM, board of directors and the aviation team.


We will aim to answer the following questions:

1.	How does the overall flight volume vary by month in 2015?
2.	What percentage of flights experienced a departure delay in 2015? Among those flights, what was the average delay time, in minutes?
3.	How does the delayed flights % vary throughout the year (monthly)?
4.	What are the top 5 busiest origin airports in 2015? And what are the top 5 origin airports with the highest departure and arrival delays?
5.	How many flights were cancelled every month for the top 5 origin airports?
6.	How many flights were cancelled in 2015? What % of cancellations were due to weather? What % were due to the Airline/Carrier fault?
7.	Which airlines seem to be most and least reliable, in terms of on-time departure in 2015?
8.	Which airlines on average depart before the set schedule in 2015?
9.	How does the distance of a trip have an influence (if any) on the arrival/departure delay of a flight?


The key conclusions to take away are:

•	The majority of delays and cancellations are due to the weather and so they are at their highest during the winter months when there are adverse weather conditions.

•	Generally, the busier the airport, the more delays and cancellations there are. However, ATL is the busiest airport and has lower rates of delays/cancellations when compared against the remaining top 5 busiest airports.

•	There is a strong positive correlation between the number of flights an airline undertakes and the total time spent delayed.


Recommendations:

•	Controlling number of flights offered

•	Professional aviation team for air control

•	Higher number of runways at Multico Air’s airports of choosing

•	Focus package deals on low-peak seasons

•	Airline Operations study for in depth information on day to day operation in the month of September as it has the lowest percentage of departure delays, to learn how to keep it low throughout the year.
